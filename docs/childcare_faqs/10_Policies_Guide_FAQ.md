# 10. Center Policies FAQ

1. **What is your discipline policy?**
   We prioritize positive reinforcement and redirection. Our goal is to teach children self-regulation. We do not use corporal punishment, shaming, or isolation (time-outs). If a behavioral issue persists, we work with parents to develop a consistent behavior plan.

2. **What is your policy on screen time?**
   We limit screen time significantly. Children under 2 have no screen time. For older children (3+), screen time is limited to 30 minutes/week for educational purposes only. We emphasize hands-on learning and active play.

3. **Do you allow toys from home?**
   We generally ask that toys from home stay at home to prevent loss or breakage. However, a "lovey" or comfort object is welcomed for naptime. We have occasional "Show and Tell" days where items can be brought in specifically for that activity.

4. **What is your late pick-up policy?**
   The center closes promptly at 6:00 PM. A late fee of $1 per minute is charged for pick-ups after 6:00 PM. Frequent late pick-ups may result in a review of continued enrollment. Please call us if you know you will be late in an emergency.

5. **how do you handle custody arrangements?**
   We strictly follow court-ordered custody arrangements. Copies of legal documents must be on file. We will not release a child to a non-custodial parent without written authorization from the custodial parent.

6. **What is your confidentiality policy?**
   We treat all family and child information with strict confidentiality. Records are kept in locked files and only accessed by authorized staff. We do not share information with third parties without your written consent.

7. **What is the policy for birthday celebrations?**
   We love to celebrate birthdays! Parents are welcome to bring a store-bought, nut-free treat to share. Please coordinate with the teacher in advance. We avoid homemade treats due to allergy regulations.

8. **Can I visit my child during the day?**
   Yes, we have an open-door policy for parents. You are welcome to visit at any time. However, we ask that you respect the classroom schedule (e.g., nap time) and minimize disruption.

9. **What is your policy on biting?**
   Biting is a common developmental stage for toddlers but we take it seriously. We shadow children who bite to intervene, use "shadowing," and work with parents. If biting is excessive and endangers others, we may require a temporary suspension to develop a plan, but expulsion is a last resort.

10. **How do I withdraw my child?**
    We require a written notice of withdrawal at least two weeks in advance. If proper notice is not given, you are responsible for tuition for those two weeks.
